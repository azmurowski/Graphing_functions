Double click to create points. You can add points anywhere and they will be sorted by x coordinate and connected by a line
In the beginning a new layer is created - this is where you insert points of the function - this is shown with a button on the side
Clicking a button that's active deactivates the layer and allows you to create a new one by creating points in the viewport
You can move points by clicking and dragging
You can enable layers to be edited by clicking the layer button. 
If you want to start over press clear - it deletes everything and gives you a clean state
